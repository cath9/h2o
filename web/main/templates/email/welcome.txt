<b>Welcome to H2O!</b>

The H2O platform allows you to make open education resources for law that are dynamic, easy-to-share, and free for students and everyone else. We’re happy to have you with us as we promote open casebooks and more.

<b>Update your Profile</b>

If you are an educator, fill in <a href="https://opencasebook.org/accounts/edit/">your profile information</a> and check the box to be verified as a professor. Once confirmed, you’ll have a green check mark next to your name and your casebooks will be surfaced in search results.

<b>Get Started</b>

You can create your first casebook with our <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org">help guides</a> and <a href="https://about.opencasebook.org/other-resources/">video tutorials</a>. 

We also encourage you to <a href="https://opencasebook.org/search/">browse our collection</a> of existing casebooks which you can adapt to create new resources by cloning them, instead of starting from scratch. 

Have questions? Just reply to this email (<a href="mailto:info@opencasebook.org">info@opencasebook.org</a>).

<b>Stay Connected</b>

If you are an educator, be sure to <a href="http://eepurl.com/hrd07P">subscribe to our newsletter</a> and follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/opencasebook">@opencasebook</a>. If you want to spread the word about open education resources for law, help us grow the H2O community by telling your colleagues about us, or by sharing out your finished casebooks so folks can see what H2O is all about.
